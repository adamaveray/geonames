A collection of (unofficial) NPM modules for efficiently accessing GeoNames.org cities data.

These packages provide generators that output each record in the data files, structured & parsed â€“ ints & floats are converted to `number`s, lists are converted to `string[]` arrays, and dates are converted to `Date` objects.

The data files are bundled with each package so can be used offline, and each package has no dependencies.

## Developing

To update the data sets, run `npm run update-datasets`.

All submodules must be built before running tests, which is done automatically by calling `npm test` or can be performed manually with `npm run prepack-all`.
